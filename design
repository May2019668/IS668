Design
The flask framework was used to design the grade book app it includes a login page with a protected password which  allows teachers to access the app. 
After login you will be able to navigate the different forms via links which allow you to access different areas within  the gradebook such as the roster, adding/removing assignments, etc.  
Python classes and objects  are  used 
In terms of the structure,  the data is stored in a  SQL database  with multiple tables with the Students, Assignments, Grades and Classrooms.  SQLAlchemy is used  to connect to the  SQL database in order to perform querying and editing tasks.
